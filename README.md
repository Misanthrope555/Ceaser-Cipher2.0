# Caesar Cipher
* This program was created using Java language.
#### Author
* Edwin Kaburu.
### Description
* This program uses a command line interface to encrypt or decrypt words using an appropriate key which is a number.
* The encryption works by shifting the word characters the number of characters provided by the key e.g encrypting 'ab' by a key of 1 makes it 'bc', while decrypting returns the original value of the encrypted word.
* If the word 'name' was encrypted using a key of 1 it would return 'obnf'.If I was to decrypt 'obnf' I would have to know the key that was used for its encryption, which is 1, for it to return 'name'.
